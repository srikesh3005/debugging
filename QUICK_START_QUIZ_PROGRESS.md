2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `migration-add-quiz-progress.sql`
4. Paste and run it

### 2. That's It! 
The code changes are already implemented in:
- ‚úÖ `QuizGame.tsx` - Auto-saves progress
- ‚úÖ `LoadingScreen.tsx` - Shows loading while restoring

## How to Test

### Test Scenario 1: Mid-Quiz Exit

6. **Expected**: You should resume from question 4 with your previous answers saved

### Test Scenario 2: Answer Persistence
1. Start a quiz
2. Answer question 1 with option "B"
3. Close browser immediately
4. Return and resume
5. **Expected**: Question 1 should still show "B" as selected

### Test Scenario 3: Complete Quiz Normally
1. Start quiz and complete all questions
2. Try to take the same quiz again
3. **Expected**: 
   - Non-test accounts: "Quiz Already Completed" message

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When You Answer a Question:
```
User selects answer ‚Üí Saved to state ‚Üí Immediately saved to database
```

### When You Move to Next Question:
```
Click Next ‚Üí Save progress ‚Üí Update question index ‚Üí Move to next
```

### When You Return to Quiz:
```
Login ‚Üí Check for incomplete attempts ‚Üí Found? ‚Üí Restore progress ‚Üí Resume quiz
                                      ‚Üí Not found? ‚Üí Start fresh quiz
```

## Database Changes
The migration adds 2 columns to `quiz_attempts` table:
- `current_question_index` - Tracks which question you're on
- `saved_answers` - JSON object storing all your answers

## Troubleshooting

### "Progress not restoring"
- Check: Did you run the migration?
- Check: Are you logged in as the same user?
- Check: Did you select the exact same quiz?

### "Getting errors"
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for red error messages
- Check if migration was applied correctly

### "Starting from beginning"
- This is normal if you completed the quiz before
- For test accounts: Previous attempts are allowed
- For regular accounts: Only one attempt per quiz

## Console Logs to Watch
Open browser console (F12) to see:
- ‚úÖ "Found existing incomplete attempt, restoring progress"
- ‚úÖ "Restored answers: {1: 'A', 2: 'B', ...}"
- ‚úÖ "Quiz progress saved"
